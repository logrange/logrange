USAGE: build [options]

    build allows to release logrange artifacts. It does the steps as following:

    1) To determine the current version. The version must be provided in --release argument
    2) If the version doesn't exist yet (no such git tag), the build changes file
version.go in the root of the repo, and commit it immediately applying the tag with
the version after that.
    3) Checking out desired version by its tag and builds it.
    4) Upload all new artifacts to S3

OPTIONS:
    -b, --branch <branch>   the value makes sense only if the tag with version doesn't exist. The
                            branch will be used for building new artifacts and tagging them by the
                            version provided. If the branch is not specified the current branch will
                            be used.
    -r, --release <version> defines the release version. Version must be in the form vX.Y.Z[suffix]
                            where X, Y and Z an numbers. Visit https://semver.org/
    -l, --latest            put into latest version the same context as for the release version
    -u, --upload            allows to upload the artifacts to S3
    -h, --help              prints the help
